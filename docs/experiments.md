# Experiments — gates, metrics, result log

## Gates (what "done" means)

| gate | test | threshold |
|---|---|---|
| G1a | constant dFc sequence ≡ shared control rollout | max&#124;Δx&#124; ≤ 1e-6·scale |
| G1b | dL/ds (material leaves + v_T adjoint) vs central FD | rel err < 0.25, finite & nonzero |
| G2 | guard counters over the full run (incl. any-step F inversion) | **all zero** |
| G3 | tail jitter over SIMULATED frames (held padding excluded) AND terminal drift v̄·dt·T/diag (dynamic family; ≡0 for VBD) | both < 0.3% bbox diag |
| G4 | hole_frac (binary 3×3 splat, FIXED target extent) | ≤ 2% AND ≤ physics arm |
| G5 | each render-driven arm vs its physics baseline, same seed/budget | sil_iou ↑, chamfer ≤ +2%, hole ↓ |
| G6 | per-frame visual QA (quicklook strips + gif over the FULL range) | closed solid, no ghost/floaters/flicker |
| Gc (VBD) | solver ‖∇E‖ ≤ tol·‖∇E₀‖ every commit | convergence = gradient-validity gate |

Metric independence: metrics share **no operator with any loss** (binary point splat, one
fixed target-derived extent, held-aware jitter, `outside_frac` ejecta telemetry); raw
simulation state only — the renderer is never consumed.

## Verification protocol

1. `pytest` (42 CPU/warp-CPU tests, incl. end-to-end smokes of both families).
2. Adversarial gate: Codex (gpt-5.6-sol, xhigh) + Claude Opus, REFUTE mode, findings cite
   file:line, implementer answers every one. Round 1 (2026-09-01): 26 findings, all fixed;
   both reviewers cleared the autograd bridge, line-search restore, projection math.
3. hyde06 runs via `scripts/pipeline_run.py`; every number states its discretisation.

## Run commands (hyde06)

```bash
cd ~/physmorph_v2

## Result log (discretisation with every number — AGENTS rule 4)

### 2026-09-01 — v2 dynamic family, FULL SCALE, hyde06 RTX 6000 Ada (all gates PASS)

`dx=0.5, dt=1/240, 64³, smoothing 0.955, loss_res 32; N=20000 isosphere→bunny, T=20,
iters=8, 30 commits, w_kin=5, w_box=10, assim=0.5(elastic), α_λ=0.5, 18 views @64px`;
0.5 min/arm.

| arm | chamfer | sil_iou | hole | jitter_rel | guards | commits |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| phys | 0.1786 | 0.8885 | 0.05% | 0.00003 | all 0 | 30/30 |
| render | **0.1439** | **0.9536** | **0.00%** | 0.00003 | all 0 | 30/30 |

λ_R self-anneals 1130→61; kin 8.97→0.002 monotone. G6: closed solid every sampled frame,
ears+paw form (tips rounder than target). Smoke-scale tuning history and ablations
(w_kin=0.5 momentum snowball; displacement-assimilation instability): git history
`2607972` and method.md §8.

### 2026-09-01 — gradient measurements (hyde06 GPU1, N=5000 T=10 probes; grad_analysis.json)

- v1 fixed-λ render contribution through the MPM adjoint: **0.04–0.3%** of the update
  (raw norm gap 150–1200×) — the "render did nothing" era, quantified. v2 norm balancing
  pins it at α_λ.
- cos(∇D_render, ∇D_vol) on dFc: **+0.68 → −0.74** across commits — render carries rim
  information the coarse mass grid opposes late; usable only under norm balancing.
- Image-space render pull is **8–16× surface-concentrated** (D_vol: 1.1–3.4×) — the
  surface-only-feedback premise, measured.
- v1 forensics (archived npz, v2 metrics): greedy tail jitter 0.00485 (fails G3); F aniso
  max 2.7 / detF 0.32 *with* the silent clamp. v2 full scale, no clamp: 1.70 / 0.51.

### 2026-09-01 — grid-GS differentiability pre-check (CPU toy, float64)

Colored block-GS solve differentiated three ways vs FD: at ‖∇E‖=3.6e-5 — unrolled 0.1%,
IFT adjoint 0.04% error; at 10 sweeps — 17%/54%. Conclusion: both routes valid at
convergence; solve tolerance is a correctness gate. `scripts/probe_gs_differentiability.py`.

### (pending) v3 arms A/B — render_ws / render_gs / vbd vs baselines at full scale
